Half-Life 2 Campaign 1.26 was an addon for an old Garry's Mod which doesn't work in Garry's Mod 13. I decided to try port this gamemode for Garry's Mod 13 to see the outcome and I must say, I'm quite happy with it.

** Please give all credits to AMT since he was the one who originally made this gamemode, I just simply ported it.
