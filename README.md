Half-Life 2 Campaign 1.26 was an addon for an old Garry's Mod which doesn't work in Garry's Mod 13. I decided to try port this gamemode for Garry's Mod 13 to see the outcome and I must say, I'm quite happy with it.

-- Information 

* I aimed the gamemode to be close to the original 1.26 version. 
* Can be played in Multiplayer or Singleplayer. 
* Checkpoints that teleport players to prevent them from getting stuck. 
* Collisions disabled for players and friendly npcs. 
* The Super Gravity Gun parts add damage to the Gravity Gun but doesn't change visual effects and you can't pick up Combine soldiers(Punting Combine kills them instantly). 

-- Knowns Issues(Issues I've seen so far) 

* EP1/EP2 cannot be played due to animations and scenes being missing. 
* The gamemode doesn't predict the amount of Health/Armor/Ammo from the last level very good. 
* Only 1 player can be the !player actor. 
* d1_trainstation_01 : The G-Man scene doesn't play correctly due to point_viewcontrol entities not working correctly. It is recommended to stay in the spot you spawned on. 
* d1_trainstation_04 : The Gordon K.O scene doesn't play in Multiplayer. This is a point_viewcontrol problem.
* d1_trainstation_05 : The part where you fall in the water and the Ichthyosaur attacks requires you to be where the Ichthyosaur aims at to teleport successfully. If you are out of the area it is aiming at, you won't be teleported and you won't be able to continue. 
* d3_citadel : Possible crash on changelevel while in pods(?) 
* d3_breen_01 : The scene after Breen uses the super gravity gun doesn't play. I added a changelevel at the elevator door to get past this issue. 

** If there is anymore bugs on any HL2 map, comment about it. 

-- Some tips 

* d1_trainstation_06 gives you a Medkit. 
* Once you die, you cannot respawn until the next map. 
* F1 for help menu. 
* You can spawn vehicles with F3(If allowed). 

-- Credits 

* AMT(Original creator of the gamemode). 

** Please give all credits to AMT since he was the one who originally made this gamemode, I just simply ported it. 


Extra tip: I won't be fixing bugs in the base of the gamemode(I'm leaving it for other people). Though, I can try fix a level with the map edit .lua files in the gamemode if a bug is present.
